<p> LCS has a compliment of well-trained and very experienced Carpet and Upholstery cleaners.
We offer a specialised business carpet and upholstery cleaning service to keep your offices
looking clean and professional. Our carpet and upholstery cleaning service uses one of two
methods.
VLM cleaning
Very low moisture (VLM) cleaning is a popular method of cleaning. This method of
upholstery and carpet cleaning uses limited water and typically drying can take place over 1-
2 hours. This method is best for businesses that need to minimise the disruption of cleaning.
Wet Extraction Cleaning
This method of upholstery and carpet cleaning is best for getting rid of stubborn stains and
grit in your carpet. This is perfect for high traffic areas in your offices and should be
repeated every 4-6 months.
We clean all sizes of carpets and seats and both of these methods are effective and
recommended based on what is required for your business. Let us remove all stains, dirt, sand
and allergens from your carpets and upholstery with our expert cleaning services.

<div class="service-details-post" id = "sanitizing">
<h3>OFFICE SANITIZING AND DISINFECTING <span></span></h3>
<p>Sanitising helps reduce the amount of bacteria and removes any contaminants which can
cause sickness. Sanitising must work in conjunction with other cleaning methods to
completely remove bacteria.
Disinfecting is the complete removal of pathogens and disease-causing microorganisms.
Disinfecting is used in hospital environments but in the current pandemic is important for a
deeper office clean.
Why you need sanitizing and disinfecting
In an expansive office space, with a large number of employees and several communal areas,
professional cleaning services are mandatory in maintaining a hygienic work space. Regular
sanitising is also imperative for reaching standardised health and safety guidelines and will
help to significantly reduce the possible transfer of germs and bacteria.
In general, areas with a large amount of traffic should be cleaned as regularly as possible and
surfaces should be cleaned with hot soapy water and dried, while specific high risk areas such
as door handles can be sanitised.
These are some of the most crucial places in the office that need regular sanitising and/or
disinfecting.
1. Telephone
2. Desktop
3. Door Handles
4. Microwave door handle
5. Keyboard
6. Surfaces which come into contact with food
7. Bathrooms and communal washrooms
Whether you are a small office or a large corporate we can formulate a customised sanitising
cleaning service to meet your requirements.

What is The Difference Between Non-Hazardous & Hazardous Waste Types?
“Waste is divided into two classes based on the risk it poses – general waste and hazardous
waste. General waste means waste that does not pose an immediate hazard or threat to
health or the environment, and includes domestic waste; building and demolition waste;
business waste; inert waste; or any waste classified as non-hazardous waste in terms of the
regulations made under section 69, and includes non-hazardous substances, materials or
objects within the business, domestic or building and demolition waste.”

solution that includes classification, collection, treatment, energy recovery and disposal. Let
